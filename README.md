## Project Description


### 🔧 Tools and Technologies Used:

- Machine learning techniques for model development 🧠💻

- Gradio for creating the web interface 🌐🖥️


## Setup

## Installation

### Manual Setup

For manual installation, you need to have `Python 3` on your system. Then you can clone this repo and be at the repo's root `https://github.com/slickHnaa/Customer-Churning-App` to follow the steps as outlined below; 

## Setting up the Environment

To run the evaluation locally, follow these steps:

1. Create a Python virtual environment to isolate the project's required libraries and avoid conflicts. Execute the following command in your terminal:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```
   
2. Activate the Python virtual environment to use the isolated Python kernel and libraries. Run the appropriate command based on your operating system:

    - For Windows:

    ```bash
    venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
    - For Linux and MacOS:

    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3. Upgrade Pip, the package manager, to ensure you have the latest version. Use the following command:

    ```bash
    python -m pip install --upgrade pip
    ```

4. Install the required libraries listed in the `requirements.txt` file. Run the command:

    ```bash
    python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

*Note: If you encounter any issues on MacOS, please make sure Xcode is installed.*

By following these steps, you will set up the necessary environment and install all the required packages to run the evaluation on your local machine.

## Running the Execution 

To run the demo app (being at the repository root), use the following command:

```bash
python app.py
```

The Gradio app will start running and provide you with a local server address (e.g., http://127.0.0.1:7860/). Open your web browser and enter this address to access the app.

Interact with the Gradio app in your web browser and test the churn prediction functionality.
